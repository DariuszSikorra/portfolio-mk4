              Hello! Iâ€™m a Full-Stack Engineer with over five years of experience, passionate about building scalable and user-friendly applications. 
              I started my career freelancing as a junior developer, creating Single Page Applications for clients. 
              <br /><br />
              At Scalac, I contributed to innovative projects like AUXI, a British job-sharing platform, and Rally Health, an American insurance platform. 
              I focused on developing features, optimizing the codebase, and leading the creation of end-to-end tests. 
              <br /><br />
              Currently, I'm working independently on a Polish e-commerce platform, Clemens, where I'm transitioning the application from Django and jQuery to Next.js and React.
              <br /><br />
              In my career, I've worked with various technologies, including React, TypeScript, Next.js, and Node.js, among others. 
              I enjoy collaborating in Scrum and Kanban teams, mentoring, and occasionally taking on recruiting responsibilities.
